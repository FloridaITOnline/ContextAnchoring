## 🧭 Overview

In traditional software engineering, **Boundary Testing** ensures that systems behave predictably at their *input limits* — testing the edges of valid ranges to catch off-by-one errors or overflow conditions.

In **Context Anchoring**, boundaries are not numeric but **semantic**.  
They define the **limits of stable reasoning**, **anchored state retention**, and **contextual determinism** within the model’s attention window.

Understanding and respecting these boundaries is essential to writing stable, reproducible **Gate Tests** and **Audit Loops**.

## ⚙️ Types of Boundaries in Context Anchoring

| **Boundary Type** | **Definition** | **Testing Goal** | **Failure Mode** |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Contextual Boundary** | The maximum stable token or character limit (≈ 10 KB / 3,500-4,000 tokens). | Verify reasoning remains consistent up to the context limit. | Loss of state, hallucination, or anchor drift. |
| **Semantic Boundary** | The edge between valid and invalid conceptual domains. | Test for reasoning integrity under ambiguous or contradictory input. | Confabulation or false generalization. |
| **Instructional Boundary** | The limit of interpretability in the Intent/Constraint pair. | Ensure the model correctly distinguishes primary vs. secondary intent. | Over-generalization or instruction bleed. |
| **Validation Boundary** | The threshold where self-audits fail to detect inconsistencies. | Confirm audit prompts catch drift and malformed outputs. | Silent logical failure or schema corruption. |

Each boundary acts like a **stress line** in linguistic computation.  
Testing them ensures that Context Anchoring systems maintain structural integrity even as complexity increases.

## 🧮 Boundary Theory and Gate Testing

In the *Context Anchoring Computing Model*, each **Gate** represents a reasoning function and each **Audit** acts as a self-test.  
To validate them, we apply **Boundary Theory** the same way developers apply unit and integration testing:

| **Testing Layer** | **Analog in Context Anchoring** | **Purpose** |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| **Unit Test** | Audit inside a Gate | Validate individual reasoning step integrity. |
| **Integration Test** | Multi-Gate anchor continuity | Ensure context survives across state transfers. |
| **Boundary Test** | Input, length, and semantic edge cases | Confirm stability near reasoning limits. |

For every Gate, boundary tests should include:
1. **Canonical Case** — Expected input and outcome.  
2. **Boundary Case** — Near the semantic or contextual edge.  
3. **Negative Case** — Invalid or contradictory data.  
4. **Reinforcement Case** — Re-run to confirm deterministic output.

This structure mirrors equivalence class testing in traditional QA — but applies it to reasoning.

## 🧠 The 10 KB Stability Boundary

Context Anchoring uses a **bounded runtime** of approximatation of 10,240 characters (≈ 3,500-4,000 tokens).  
This isn’t arbitrary — it’s a **stability envelope**, ensuring that the prompt has reliablility between model token availability variations. 
Beyond this limit:
- Anchors may degrade (loss of context references)
- Audits may lose fidelity
- Reinforcement Loops may oscillate or diverge
- It is important to understand your intended Model's Token Availability. Test and if Drift occurs, one thing you can try is to reduce the Bounded Runtime.

**Boundary Testing** ensures that every orchestration respects this runtime constraint.  
If drift begins near 9,000–10,000 characters, the audit should detect and flag the instability — this is *expected behavior*, not failure.

## 🧩 Example: Boundary Test Pattern

Test Name: ANCHOR_STABILITY_NEAR_LIMIT
Goal: Verify that semantic anchors remain stable near 9 500–10 000 characters.

Steps:
1. Run multi-gate orchestration with cumulative context size of 9,800–10,000 chars.
2. Observe whether audit confirms state retention across last two gates.
3. If audit drift occurs, confirm Recovery Loop reanchors correctly.

Expected Result:
✅ Stable anchor replication or self-correction message.
⚠️ Drift detected but recovered through Reinforcement Loop.
❌ Context collapse or logical reset (failure condition).
