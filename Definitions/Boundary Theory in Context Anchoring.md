## 🧭 Overview

In traditional software engineering, **Boundary Testing** ensures that systems behave predictably at their *input limits* — testing the edges of valid ranges to catch off-by-one errors or overflow conditions.

In **Context Anchoring**, boundaries are not numeric but **semantic**.  
They define the **limits of stable reasoning**, **anchored state retention**, and **contextual determinism** within the model’s attention window.

Understanding and respecting these boundaries is essential to writing stable, reproducible **Gate Tests** and **Audit Loops**.

## ⚙️ Types of Boundaries in Context Anchoring

| **Boundary Type** | **Definition** | **Testing Goal** | **Failure Mode** |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Contextual Boundary** | The maximum stable token or character limit (≈ 10 KB / 3 500 tokens). | Verify reasoning remains consistent up to the context limit. | Loss of state, hallucination, or anchor drift. |
| **Semantic Boundary** | The edge between valid and invalid conceptual domains. | Test for reasoning integrity under ambiguous or contradictory input. | Confabulation or false generalization. |
| **Instructional Boundary** | The limit of interpretability in the Intent/Constraint pair. | Ensure the model correctly distinguishes primary vs. secondary intent. | Over-generalization or instruction bleed. |
| **Validation Boundary** | The threshold where self-audits fail to detect inconsistencies. | Confirm audit prompts catch drift and malformed outputs. | Silent logical failure or schema corruption. |

Each boundary acts like a **stress line** in linguistic computation.  
Testing them ensures that Context Anchoring systems maintain structural integrity even as complexity increases.

## 🧮 Boundary Theory and Gate Testing

In the *Context Anchoring Computing Model*, each **Gate** represents a reasoning function and each **Audit** acts as a self-test.  
To validate them, we apply **Boundary Theory** the same way developers apply unit and integration testing:

| **Testing Layer** | **Analog in Context Anchoring** | **Purpose** |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| **Unit Test** | Audit inside a Gate | Validate individual reasoning step integrity. |
| **Integration Test** | Multi-Gate anchor continuity | Ensure context survives across state transfers. |
| **Boundary Test** | Input, length, and semantic edge cases | Confirm stability near reasoning limits. |

For every Gate, boundary tests should include:
1. **Canonical Case** — Expected input and outcome.  
2. **Boundary Case** — Near the semantic or contextual edge.  
3. **Negative Case** — Invalid or contradictory data.  
4. **Reinforcement Case** — Re-run to confirm deterministic output.

This structure mirrors equivalence class testing in traditional QA — but applies it to reasoning.

## 🧠 The 10 KB Stability Boundary

Context Anchoring uses a **bounded runtime** of approximately 10 240 characters (≈ 3 500 tokens).  
This isn’t arbitrary — it’s a **stability envelope**, ensuring that all atoms (Intent, Constraint, Gate, Audit, Anchor, Loop, State) coexist inside one reasoning window.

Beyond this limit:
- Anchors degrade (loss of context references)
- Audits lose fidelity
- Reinforcement Loops may oscillate or diverge

**Boundary Testing** ensures that every orchestration respects this runtime constraint.  
If drift begins near 9 000–10 000 characters, the audit should detect and flag the instability — this is *expected behavior*, not failure.

## 🧩 Example: Boundary Test Pattern

```text
Test Name: ANCHOR_STABILITY_NEAR_LIMIT
Goal: Verify that semantic anchors remain stable near 9 500–10 000 characters.

Steps:
1. Run multi-gate orchestration with cumulative context size of 9 800–10 000 chars.
2. Observe whether audit confirms state retention across last two gates.
3. If audit drift occurs, confirm Recovery Loop reanchors correctly.

Expected Result:
✅ Stable anchor replication or self-correction message.
⚠️ Drift detected but recovered through Reinforcement Loop.
❌ Context collapse or logical reset (failure condition).
