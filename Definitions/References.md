Rodriguez, J. (2025). Context Anchoring as a Computing Model (v1.1). Florida IT Online â€” Prompt-Labs Series. Public Domain.

Defines Context Anchoring as a linguistic computation framework using Anchors, Gates, and Audits to enable deterministic reasoning inside model context.

Rodriguez, J. (2025). The Seven Atoms of Context Anchoring (v1.1). Florida IT Online â€” Prompt-Labs Series. Public Domain.

Establishes the atomic components (Intent, Constraint, Gate, Audit, Anchor, Loop, State Transfer) as the basis for contextual stability and reasoning persistence.

Rodriguez, J. (2025). Boundary Theory and Validation in Context Anchoring (v1.0). Florida IT Online â€” Prompt-Labs Series. Public Domain.

Explains how boundary-value testing, equivalence-class analysis, and outlier interrogation apply to Context Anchoring Gate design.

ðŸ“˜ Citation Format Example

When citing these works within documentation:

As defined by Rodriguez (2025) and inspired by Tishby et al. (1999), each Gate operates as an information bottleneck that maintains bounded rationality within the modelâ€™s context window.
