## 📌 What Is a Gate?

> **A Gate is a discrete reasoning step that transforms anchored context into new output.  
Each Gate has defined input, a constrained operation, and a predictable output.**

Gates function like **procedural blocks** in a pipeline—executing a bounded task and passing results forward.

They are the work units of Context Anchoring.

## 🧩 Core Properties

1) **Structured**  
   Each Gate has a clear purpose.

2) **Input-Bound**  
   Consumes Anchors and/or previous Gate output.

3) **Deterministic**  
   Same Anchors → Similar output.

4) **Scoped**  
   Performs one semantic task only.

5) **Auditable**  
   May include or follow an Audit step.

6) **Composable**  
   Gates connect sequentially to form pipelines.

## 🎯 Why Gates Exist

Gates:
- Break work into controlled stages
- Enforce order
- Prevent reasoning drift
- Localize error detection
- Enable regeneration only where needed
- Provide predictability + traceability

Gates turn **Anchors → Action**.

## 🚫 What Gates Are *Not*

Gates are **not**:
- Loose suggestions
- Vague reasoning
- Unbounded logic
- Hidden chain-of-thought
- Multi-purpose blocks

They must be:
- **Explicit**
- **Bounded**
- **Task-specific**

---

## 🔁 Gate Lifecycle

1) **Input**  
   Read Anchors and/or prior Gate output

2) **Execution**  
   Perform defined reasoning / generation

3) **Audit (optional but encouraged)**  
   Validate against Contracts

4) **Output**  
   Pass result to next Gate; may form new Anchor

## 🏗️ Gate Structure

- **Name/ID:** G1, G2, G3…  
- **Purpose:** What task the Gate performs  
- **Input:** Anchors + previous output  
- **Operation:** Logic / generation step  
- **Output:** Data passed forward  
- **(Optional) Audit:** Validates output meets Contract

## 🔄 Example — Vocabulary Forge

| Gate | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **G1** | Teacher chooses topic + difficulty |
| **G2** | AI generates puzzle |
| **G3** | Student attempts answer |
| **G4** | AI verifies correctness |
| **G5** | AI gives micro-feedback |
| **G6** | AI summarizes progress |
| **G7** | Next round begins |

Each Gate is discrete, context-aware, and passes its output forward.

## 🧠 Role in Context Anchoring

Gates are where **reasoning happens.**

- Anchors store persistent state  
- **Gates manipulate that state**

Gates enable controlled iterative reasoning under the Context Anchoring model.

## ✅ Minimal Definition

> **A Gate is a named reasoning step with defined input and output, responsible for transforming anchored context under constraints, optionally verified by audit.**
